      # Understanding Card Tokenization: The Future of Secure Payments

      Card tokenization is revolutionizing how we handle payment data security. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore what tokenization is, why it matters, and how Tychee SDK leverages this technology.

      ## What is Card Tokenization?

      Card tokenization is the process of replacing sensitive card data with a unique identifier (token) that can be used for transactions without exposing the original card information. This approach significantly reduces the risk of data breaches and fraud.

      ### How It Works

      1. **Data Collection**: Card details are captured from the cardholder
      2. **Tokenization**: The sensitive data is replaced with a unique token
      3. **Vault Storage**: The original data is securely stored, while the token is used for transactions
      4. **Verification**: When needed, the token can be used to retrieve the data in a secure manner

      ## Benefits of Card Tokenization

      - **Enhanced Security**: Reduces the exposure of sensitive card data
      - **Compliance**: Helps meet PCI-DSS and other regulatory requirements
      - **Fraud Reduction**: Makes unauthorized use of tokens significantly harder
      - **Customer Trust**: Demonstrates commitment to data protection
      - **Scalability**: Enables secure payment processing at scale

      ## Tychee SDK's Approach

      Tychee SDK implements card tokenization using:

      - **Client-Side Encryption**: AES-256-GCM encryption happens locally before any data leaves the user's device
      - **Self-Custody Model**: Users maintain control of their encryption keys
      - **On-Chain Storage**: Encrypted tokens are stored on Stellar Soroban for transparency and security
      - **Account Abstraction**: Optional abstraction layer for simplified key management

      ## Implementation Best Practices

      When implementing tokenization in your application:

      1. Always encrypt data client-side before transmission
      2. Never store raw card data in your database
      3. Use unique tokens for each transaction
      4. Implement proper access controls
      5. Monitor for suspicious activity

      Card tokenization is not just a feature—it's a fundamental requirement for modern, secure payment systems.

      # AES-256 Encryption: Protecting Your Card Data

      In an era of increasing cyber threats, strong encryption is non-negotiable. AES-256-GCM is the gold standard for protecting sensitive data, and Tychee SDK leverages it to safeguard card information.

      ## What is AES-256?

      AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a 256-bit key is a symmetric encryption algorithm that uses a 256-bit key to encrypt and decrypt data. It's considered secure enough for classified government information.

      ### How It Works

      1. **Key Generation**: A 256-bit key is generated (32 bytes)
      2. **Plaintext**: The card data to be encrypted
      3. **Algorithm**: Data is processed through 14 rounds of mathematical operations
      4. **Ciphertext**: The encrypted result that is unreadable without the key
      5. **Decryption**: Same algorithm used in reverse with the correct key

      ## What About GCM?

      GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) adds authentication to encryption:

      - Ensures data hasn't been tampered with
      - Provides both confidentiality and integrity
      - Detects unauthorized modifications
      - Standard for modern security applications

      ## Why Client-Side Encryption?

      Tychee SDK performs encryption on the client (user's device) because:

      - **Immediate Protection**: Data is encrypted before leaving the device
      - **Key Control**: Users maintain exclusive access to encryption keys
      - **Reduced Trust**: Server never sees unencrypted card data
      - **Compliance**: Aligns with security best practices and regulations

      ## Performance Considerations

      Despite its strength, AES-256:

      - Performs well on modern hardware
      - Has minimal latency impact on user experience
      - Is optimized in browsers through Web Crypto API
      - Scales efficiently for high-volume transactions

      ## Best Practices

      When using encryption in payment systems:

      1. **Never log keys**: Keep encryption keys out of logs
      2. **Rotate keys**: Periodically update keys for old data
      3. **Secure storage**: Store keys in secure vaults
      4. **Unique IVs**: Use unique initialization vectors for each encryption
      5. **Regular audits**: Review encryption implementation regularly

      AES-256-GCM represents the current state-of-the-art in symmetric encryption for protecting sensitive financial data.
